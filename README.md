#### nixos made simple

## OwO What's this?

Alysios is a project with the goal of making nix from something difficult, to something simple.

Rather than making GUI elements for the entire nixos ecosystem like SnowflakeOS does, Alysios has a simple(ish) set of Nix flakes which are bound to .desktop files such that they are opened when desired. These may wind up with GUIs at a later point in time but these would still be extremely specialised to modify a specific file in a specific way, rather than attempting to grant full control over the nix ecosystem (after all, more complex configuration is the entire point of the nix language.)

Prior to installation you will want to adjust the setup-settings.nix file. It should be pretty easy to understand that one at least.
